## 🌈 Why Aura?

Coding should be as natural as writing an email. Aura is a transpiler engine that understands English commands and converts them into production-ready React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS web applications.

- **🗣️ Natural English Syntax**: No more brackets or semicolons. Just tell Aura what you want.
- **🧠 Brain-Powered**: Integrated semantic engine (Qwen-0.5B) for silent syntax correction and intelligent parsing.
- **⚡ Hot Reload**: Instant updates as you save your `.aura` files.
- **🎨 Premium Aesthetics**: Built-in themes with glassmorphism, smooth animations, and modern gradients.

## 📝 The Aura Syntax

Writing Aura is like describing your UI to a friend.

```aura
Use the dark theme

Create a heading with the text 'Welcome to the Future'
Create a paragraph with the text 'This page was built using plain English.'

Create a button with the text 'Click Me'
When clicked, display 'Hello from Aura! 🎉'
```

## 📂 Project Organization

Aura projects are structured to be neat and intuitive:

- `transpiler/` — The core engine logic (Parser, HTML Generator, CLI).
- `docs/` — Comprehensive guides and technical specifications.
- `examples/` — A library of Aura snippets to learn from.
- `playground/` — A pre-configured project to test Aura live.
- `tools/` — Utility scripts for debugging and specialized setups.
- `vscode-extension/` — Official VS Code support for `.aura` syntax.

---

## 🎮 The Playground

We've included a `playground/` directory so you can try Aura immediately without creating a new project.

```bash
# Go to the playground
cd playground

# Start the dev server
aura dev
```
